# jcode Telemetry Worker

Cloudflare Worker that receives anonymous telemetry events from jcode.

## Setup

1. Install wrangler: `npm install`

2. Create D1 database:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create jcode-telemetry
   ```

3. Update `wrangler.toml` with the database ID from step 2

4. Initialize schema:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --file=schema.sql
   ```

### Migrating an existing database

If your production database was created before the latest telemetry fields were added,
apply all remote migrations:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0001_expand_events.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0002_transport_metrics.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0003_usage_expansion.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0004_telemetry_phase123.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0005_workflow_turn_telemetry.sql
```

Then redeploy the worker:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

6. Set up custom domain (optional): point `telemetry.jcode.dev` to the worker in Cloudflare dashboard

# Tool and response latency (last 30d)

```

## What to watch for

- `session_start` far exceeding `session_end + session_crash` for multiple days
- `session_crash = 0` for long periods despite known crashes
- large `lifecycle_ids_without_install` counts
- a single telemetry ID dominating session totals (dev/test skew)
- zeroed transport totals after transport-aware releases (missing migration)
